a small purple car is parked and there is a fume coming out at the front mrbean is walking very lightly to the trunk looking delighted
he open the trunk and get a big briefcase that is a big a him his body is almost not seen when he is getting the briefcase
he turn around and mumble something at the briefcase while holding it up and take a big step marching to the opposite of the car while leaving the trunk open why did he not close the trunk is it not his car should he not take care of his stuff
there is a shady looking guy wearing a coat and glove in the front seat and the front part of the car look damaged the guy look perplexed and constantly rubbing his face the fume is still coming out in the front
he suddenly look quite angry mrbean with the briefcase is getting inside a green car and reach the door of the car to close it the car is parked in the middle of plaza where there are european looking building all around and on the left there are many outside table and chair for the restaurant or a cafe also there are some fallen chair on the right side why is he so hurrying and look nervous is he doing something bad

the guy on the right turn around with eye wide open looking surprised and then the left one also look around left one look like a clown with weird makeup they run to each side of the screen to avoid the purple car running towards them after it ran away they come to the middle to see what is going on i think the purple car is running after mrbean as it seems rushed to go after mrbean
the scene change to dome shaped top of the building with the england flag flapping in the wind the weather seems nice with blue sky and some cloud
the scene zoom out to show the whole building on the column of the building there are banner with vincent van gogh written on it it is probably an art museum a red double deck bus and a black car is running in the big road in front of the museum and there is a green car running behind the red double decker
mrbean stop the green car in front of the museum he is looking outside of the window is he looking at the poster on the wall of the building
he step outside of the car with the door opposite side of the road and take the briefcase out of the car and close the door with his left foot why did he not come out of the door where the road is
mrbean run fast while holding the briefcase tight to himself and while he is running the purple car appears from the back corner and run fast towards him
the shady man with the coat park the car in front of mrbean green car and look outside the window
a fat policeman probably a security guard at the entrance inside the museum is dozing off holding a cup on the right hand sitting on a low chair while mrbean is running past him with the briefcase he is definitely doing something bad
there is a female nude figure inside the gallery and framed picture on the wall when mrbean ran and saw the nude figure he is very surprised and embarrassed so cover his face with the briefcase and look the other side where there is also another nude figure he really try hard to not look at them
suddenly mrbean discovers something on the opposite wall looking very delighted by what he is seeing what made him so delightful
mrbean is trying to take a picture with a framed artwork of flower in a vase but when he lowered his body his butt accidentally touched the laser in the front of the artwork making the alarm going off and the policeman in the entrance wake up spilling the coffee

he walk to the right going down the stair he is really fat
mrbean is still looking at the laser his butt just touched and then he suddenly try to touch it again with his butt he is probably checking out the alarm system
he put the camera inside his jacket and bend over to touch the laser with his finger then he is startled by it and take out a handkerchief from his jacket
he wave the handkerchief and then drop it to the laser continuing to test the alarm system he is probably thinking himself that he is very smart doing this
the handkerchief go past through the red laser he look at what just happened and burst into laughter
he suddenly get surprised and turn to look behind there are several people outside the hall walking towards the gallery that he is inside i thought it would be the police coming but it just look like random visitor who is coming
the people coming appear to be schoolgirl with uniform mrbean look at them with his hand folded with a smile tilting his head he look a bit creepy looking at them like that
all of sudden mrbean look very frightened and cover his face with hand did something bad happen
he is looking at the left side of the gallery with the female nude figure in the left and then look right where the male nude figure is he seems flustered
he point the right side of him with his finger with his eye wide open and run to his left a group of schoolgirl with a pink notebook are coming inside the gallery the floor is very shiny
they are laughing and talking and walking towards the hall they seem to have good time together in the extramural activity
they approach a nude figure with a jacket on and seem very interested and happy to have found it some girl are laughing and pointing at the figure there is a female teacher with a short hair in the back with her eye closed
while the girl are laughing hard at the figure the teacher look at it and get a bit shocked it is a female nude figure with a brown jacket with two button closed while revealing most of her breast

the old security guard open the private door while mrbean and two police officer are watching there is an artwork on an easel but it has a lot of foam on it
there is a lot of foam on the artwork and the museum custodian appears with a brush putting it on the picture so this guy is a custodian taking care of the picture that is why he was wearing an apron

the shady guy decides quickly to give up stealing and grab his briefcase on the floor
mrbean blow air on the picture and wave it to make it dry he did not see that the shady guy left without stealing the artwork
mrbean is looking at the picture that has not started yet to show it figure so now i understand why he think the shady guy stole the sunflower artwork it is because the custodian took away the picture while he was not looking but he saw the shady guy trying to steal the picture
