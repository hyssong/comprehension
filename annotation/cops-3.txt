the man walk right behind the man with a suit and walk over a furniture on the way

the man swing his arm in kind of an agreement to what the cry man is saying and sits down next to him

the man seems shocked by his story with his jaw dropped
the man sitting next to the cry man mumble something look at his left and point with his finger while the man is cry with exaggerated gesture
the cry man seems like explaining something to the man sitting next to him it is probably related to what the man pointed at his left
explanation about what the cry man is supposed to do right now selling the furniture
explanation about what the cry man is supposed to do right now selling the furniture
the man is thinking hard after listening to the cry man story this is probably all a lie but the man is believing it
the man reach for his pocket probably to get the money out while the man next to him is still cry out loud he is going to buy the furniture
one man appears in the street while there is a group of police officer running behind him and towards him unsure if that man is also a police officer or just a man because i can not see his uniform from far

a half bald man who came with the woman seems like introducing her to the general this woman is probably from the earlier scene the one that ignored a police officer in front of the door
